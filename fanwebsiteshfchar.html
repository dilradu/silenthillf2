                Hinako is the game’s protagonist: a shy, determined high school student from rural Ebisugaoka in the 1960s. Once cheerful as a child, she’s grown quiet and restrained under social pressure and family expectations. When fog and monstrous horrors overrun her town, she must fight to survive and discover her own strength.

                Shu is Hinako’s childhood friend and ally. Raised in a family of physicians, he is knowledgeable about medicine and often serves as a calming, reliable presence.
